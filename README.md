# Ilya Like That - A Personal Wishlist

The goal of this project was to create a simple website with a personal wishlist. It allows authorized users (friends and family) to "book" a gift, ensuring that presents aren't duplicated.

## Features

🎁 Gift Booking System: To avoid duplicates, guests can "book" a gift, marking it as reserved for everyone else to see.

🔄 Flexible Reservation Management: Changed your mind or found something better? You can easily cancel your reservation on an item at any time.

🎉 No Limits: Guests are welcome to reserve as many gifts as they wish, with no limitations.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js
- UI Library: React
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Database: Vercel KV - A serverless Redis database used to store the wishlist items and their booking status
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Lucide React
